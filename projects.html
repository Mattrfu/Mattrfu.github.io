          <h4>Story Recommender</h4>
          <p>I created a fanfiction story recommender that used unsupervised clustering based on user comments and like patterns to generate story recommendations. The user comments and like patterns were scraped.</p>

          </a>
          <div class="collapse" id="collapseOne">
              <div class="card card-body" style="width: 100%;">
                <h5>How I created this project</h5>
                <p>
                  My story recommender is built using python. In particular, I use both a minimum spanning tree and unsupervised clustering to create my recommendations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I gathered the data for the difference matrix by scraping off fanfiction.net. I used both beautiful soup to scrape data myself as well as a fanfiction api -- not created by fanfiction.net -- to gather other data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I only scraped a total of 800 stories for this project. In part, fanfiction.net does not work well with scraping due to the way the website is created. Thus, additional scraping didn't feel efficient or worth it.
                </p>
                <h5>The unsupervised clustering and minimum spanning tree</h5>
                <p>
                  Here is the visualization of the unsupervised clustering and minimum spanning three. We see the three different linkages that I considered for the hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, the bottom right corner represents a
                  visualization of the minimum spanning tree. It should be noted that the clustering shown only shows a random sample of 100 of the total stories sampled. As the number increases, the dendrogram becomes harder to understand. Thus, the final clustering is not exactly this image.

                <h5>Story recommendation examples</h5>
                <p>
                  Here are two examples of recommendations I recieved based on two stories I threw in. The first was a random story from the dataset, and the second was a well known story. I am going to use only Harry Potter Fanfiction for these examples.
                </p>
                <h6>Story 1: A Marriage Most Convenient by AnneM.Oliver</h6>
                <p>
                  In the first example, I inputted a random Harry Potter fanfiction called A Marriage Most Convenient by AnneM.Oliver.
                  It was selected at random from among my dataset. In turn, I got out the following stories: Revenge is All The Sweeter by Twilight to Midnight, Simply Irresistible by bookworm1993, A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy by Countess Abe, Draco and Hermione by Jiigglypuff
                </p>
                <p>
                  In particular, the last story is very aptly named for this set of stories. In every one, a relationship between Hermione and Draco is featured. While the mode for the development of their relationship may be different, they all feature the same romantic outcome.
                  Here, I think the recommendation has a solid success. While the stories are not the same, they all share major similarities.
                  All four outputs relate to the input, and all five are themselves related to each other.
                  In part, this may be because the stories are less popular on regular commendation sites -- like reddit -- resulting in overlap being due to native story discovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Descriptions as well as links to stories are below.
                </p>
                <h6>Story 2: Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi</h6>
                <p>
                  In the second example, I inputted a well known harry potter fanfiction called Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi.
                  In turn, I got out out the following stories: Dark Lord Potter Part 1 by The Santi, On the Way to Greatness by Mira Mirth, Harry Potter and the Quantum Leap by Seel'vor, Manipulating Fate by Midnight Start 25.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In particular, these stories show that not all stories recommended for a single input will all be related. DLP Part 1 is similar to the original in large part due to similar authors. On the way to greatness has relation in terms of following the "different hosue trope," in which Harry is sorted into a different house.
                  HP and the Quantum Leap shares a knack for "discovery" with HP and the Boy who lived. Both stories have harry "discover" major things that change the course of the story. Manipulating Fate is similar in this regard.
                  Altogether, all four recommended stories are well related to HP and the Boy who Lived, but they are not necessarily extremely related themselves.
                </p>

                <h5>Takeaways</h5>
                <p>
                  At the end of the day, this project was a labor to try and create a recommendation system so I could find new stories. To that end, it does that, and I am happy some recommendation does occur.
                  However, it does have a few flaws.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, the decision to use only 800 stories is less than ideal. Given that there are nearly a million fanfiction stories on fanfiction.net, a very large portion of stories are left out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Second, as might be surmised with nearly 1 million stories, many stories are pretty bad. Some are certainly extremely good, but similar like and comment patterns does not necessarily result in "high quality" pieces of writing being recommended.
                  Instead, as we note in the examples, the recommender is more likely to find stories that are more similar in topic, as opposed to being more similar in writing quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, while this project does find similar stories to some degree, it does not necessarily guarantee that you will find stories that you might enjoy.

          <h4>Simple Attendance Tracker</h4>
          <p>We created a simple attendance tracker for a large high school robotics team that was focused on tracking how many hours someone was working on their project. With functionality that included check-ins, check-outs, hour confirmations, deletes, history, and a roster, the project was meant to give the team the tools it needed to really find out how many hours went into every project.</p>
